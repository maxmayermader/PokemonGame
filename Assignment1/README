***Assignemnt1.01***

How to run:
    make
    ./Assignment1


Bugs:
    not sure if it's a bug but it can take a while to run.

    Sometimes there there is a segmentation fault if you keep on trying to run the program. Usually works on the first try, but not if you keep trying to run it.

    If were supposed to have two differint biomes sometimes they can morph into one big one.

    If generation takes too long or doesn't work I just close the terminal and reopen it and then re run it
