How to run:
    make
    ./Game


Bugs:
    if PC doesn't spawn on road it is possible that the weight map wont be able to reach to the player

    if you ask for a lot of pcs there will be an infinte loop because there are no more places left to put it. you can have at leat 500 npcs depending on the map.

    Sometimes PC and NPC will chase each other and will enter a battle even if you try to move on its space

    after entering a battle u need to hit escape key and then you can move the player

    when entering coordinates you will be prompted to enter coordinates you should enter like -200 -200. You wont see what you type.
    press enter
