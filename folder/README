How to run:
    make
    ./Game


Bugs:
    when entering coordinates you will be prompted to enter coordinates you should enter like -200 -200. You wont see what you type.
    press enter

    there are pokemon moves that have the same name but have differnt ids

    when you enter an interface press escape then move the pc to get map back

    when printing sometimes the line won't clear all the way but the change in health (or miss) is reflected in the screen and next turn

    if damage is too high program may crash
